On the other hand, it is possible to represent such state in three dimensions (with real numbers). This representation is called Bloch sphere.In three dimensions, we have axes: x, y, and z. X refers to the rotation with respect to x-axis. Similarly, we have the rotation with respect to y-axis and z-axis. In Bronze, we will also see the operator Z (z-gate).
